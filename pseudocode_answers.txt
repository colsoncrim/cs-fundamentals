Short Answer:

1) Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    Programmers use pseudocode to help develop algorithms. It enables programmers to express what code should do. It is essentially
    like brainstorming before you begin coding.

2) If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    You would get an error or undefined returned if you ran pseudocode on your computer. Since it is not a programming language,
    computers can read or interpret pseudocode.


Programming Assignment:
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

    INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    IF first number is greater than second number
      PRINT first number
    ELSE
      PRINT second number
    END IF

2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

    WHILE number is 1 to 100
      PRINT number
    END WHILE


3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

    REPEAT
      WRITE "555-555-5555"
      READ Number
    UNTIL Number = 555-555-5555


4) Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var numbers = [555-555-5553, 555-555-5554, 555-555-5555];

function numberSearch(number) {
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] === number) {
      console.log("Found number" + number + "at index" + i);
      return true;
    }

  }
  return false;
}

var number = numberSearch(555-555-5555);
if (!item) {
  console.log("Number does not exist");
}
