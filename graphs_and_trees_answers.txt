1.What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

    A binary tree is a data structure made up of nodes, where each node contains a left child
    (always a lesser value than the node above), and a right node (always a larger value). The
    topmost node in the tree is called the root node.

2. What is a heuristic?

    A heuristic is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods
    are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find
    any exact solution.


3. What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

    Artificial Intelligence algorithms based on machine learning where the computer builds up a
    knowledge base from previous experiences is another application of heuristic algorithms.
    In this case the algorithm uses a self-maintained knowledge base to inform decisions and make
    “educated guesses” based on previous experiences.


4. What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

    The major difference between BFS and DFS is that BFS proceeds level by level while DFS follows
    first a path from the starting node to the ending node, then another path from the start to end,
    and so on until all nodes are visited. BFS also uses the queue for storing the nodes whereas DFS
    uses the stack for traversal of the nodes.


5. Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

    This type of graph is one that connects two nodes, so that they don't form loops, and do not assign
    the cost of travel between nodes.


6. What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

    A binary search tree is a directed, a-cyclic, unweighted graph.




Programming Questions:


For the following questions, describe in words how you could solve the problem and then do so. Use the
depiction of the Binary Search Tree to refer to the examples.


1. Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists
   within the tree.
   Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

   Written explanation: I will write a function that uses breadth-first-search to check to see whether a
   certain value exists in a given tree. If/else statements would be advantageous in this case to check
   each individual value.


   class BinarySearchTree {
     constructor() {

       this.root = null;
     }

     insertNumberNode(data, left = null, right = null) {

       let Node = {
         data,
         left,
         right
       };

       let currentNumberNode;

       if (!this.root) {
         this.root = Node;
       } else {
         currentNumberNode = this.root;
         while (currentNumberNode) {
           if (data < currentNumberNode.data) {
             if (!currentNumberNode.left) {
               currentNumberNode.left = Node;
               break;
             } else {
               currentNumberNode = currentNumberNode.left;
             }
           } else if (data > currentNumberNode.data) {
             if (!currentNumberNode.right) {
               currentNumberNode.right = Node;
               break;
             } else {
               currentNumberNode = currentNumberNode.right;
             }
           } else {
             console.log("Try Different Value");
             break;
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   let BSTtest = new BinarySearchTree();

   //tests

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(10);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(7);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(14);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(5);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(13);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(8);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(18);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(15);

   BSTtest.insertNumberNode(6);

   BSTtest;


2. Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that finds the distance
   between the two nodes.

   In order to find the distance between n1 and n2, we will need to find the LCA (lowest common ancestor)
   of the two nodes. Once we do so, then we can find the distance between LCA and the 2 nodes.


   function Node(val){
    this.value = val;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
}

function BinarySearchTree(value) {
 this.root = null;
};

BinarySearchTree.prototype.push = function(val){
   var root = this.root;

   if(!root){
      this.root = new Node(val);
      return;
   }

   var currentNode = root;
   var newNode = new Node(val);

   while(currentNode){
      if(val < currentNode.value){
          if(!currentNode.left){
             currentNode.left = newNode;
             break;
          }
          else{
             currentNode = currentNode.left;
        }
     }
     else{
         if(!currentNode.right){
            currentNode.right = newNode;
            break;
         }
         else{
            currentNode = currentNode.right;
         }
     }
  }

}

BinarySearchTree.prototype.levelOfNode =
    function(root, key, level){
      if(root === null){
        return -1;
      }else if(root.value === key){
        return level;
      }
  let l = this.levelOfNode(root.left, key, level+1)
    if (l!== -1){
      return l;
    }
    return this.levelOfNode(root.right, key, level +1)
  }

BinarySearchTree.prototype.lca = function(root, n1, n2){
   if(!root) return;
   var val = root.value;
   if(n1<val && n2<val){
     return lca(root.left, n1, n2);
   }
   if(n1>val && n2>val){
     return lca(root.right, n1, n2);
  }
  return this.root;
}

BinarySearchTree.prototype.findDistance = function(root, n1, n2){
  let lcaValue = this.lca(root, n1, n2);

  let l1 = this.levelOfNode(lcaValue, n1, 0);
  let l2 = this.levelOfNode(lcaValue, n2, 0);

  return l1 + l2;

}

let tree = new BinarySearchTree();

tree.push(4);
tree.push(8);
tree.push(9);
tree.push(11);
tree.push(3);

tree.findDistance(4,8,11);
